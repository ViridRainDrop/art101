					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>
						Some problem that we face when doing lab 13 was that we  questioned did we do the lab correctly or did we understadn the requirment wrong.
						<br>
						The reference that we was was for task X but we must tooked it as an example of how it should look like once we finish task 2.
                    </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>
                    Overall, I think this lab was simple but also challenge our understand of what we learn in class. We have to really understand the lecture to know what we expect to build.
