					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>
                    The challenge of this lab would be going back to everyone's lab and checking if everyone had any bugs.
					<br>
					It was a lot of work and lab to go over.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>
						Some problems we encouter would be, some of the code in my file does function but in Jeffery's file it doesn't and the other way aound. 
						<br>
						But we do our labs together, so we had a similar structures, we could see whats wrong with each othe's code and fix that issue.
                    </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>
                    We double check all of our work, and all of them desn't need debugged. But for Lab 8, our task X was never debugged.

					<h2>Debugging</h2>
                    <p>
						The debugged issue was below. In our html page, you could see in image 1, below "Your map results here:" does not show anything. After debugged, the input appeared like image 2
