					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>There isn't much challenges when doing this part of lab, everything was pretty straight forward.
						And all the stuff was taught during lecture. So we did not encounter harsh challenges.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problem we encounter would be a samm error that we got when we were doing the js file, 
						I missed a ) key and that cause the whole bottom part of the code stop functioning.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall we did a fine job on Lab 6. 
					We did not get time to actually meet up, but we did manage to communicate our thought and issues on dicord.
					<br>
					Although we were lacking on metting time, but we make sure we have communicate, so I think we gave out positive energy. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>
						For Lab 6, Task 1 was very straight forward, I did forgot the do my main transport at the beginning, but I ssoon went back and did that.
						<br>
						For Task 2,  I did have a little hard time trying to debugging it, but that was less than 1 hour.
