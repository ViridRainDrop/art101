					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Lab 3 went very well. It was a some what easy lab for our group. 
						But it does gave out a positive energy, althought it is easy, but I still came together and make sure we get the course material.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>
						Overall I think Lab 3 is a some what easy lab. I think we encounter some easy question that troulbe ue becuase we cannot remember some stuff.
						But we solve those issue in the next few minute. So there isn't much that bother our group for this lab.
