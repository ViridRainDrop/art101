					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Some challenges that we encounter would be trying to understand what part of the code is Pseudocode and which part of the code is actual coding.
						Because in the example that was given, we see a lot of example of Pseudocode mixed with code.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When doing Pseudocode, many questions emerged, for example, we are having issues thinking about the steps in our activity. 
						We were doing Rock, Paper, Scissors for the Pseudocode, and are having trouble imagin whats the code for doing it digitally. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> The project went well, we make sure we keep a tight communications even outside of school, making sure both of us know that to do.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>For Lab 4, there isn't much coding that was happening, most of our effert was on the Pseudocode, and trying to figure out what should be included in Pseudocode.</p>
